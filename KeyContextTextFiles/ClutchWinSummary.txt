📌 Summary of the Ranking System Adjustments & Key Metrics (Focusing on Clutch & Win Shares)
We've gone through multiple refinements to make your ranking system accurately reflect a player's impact on team performance and winning ability. Here’s the key takeaways, focusing on clutch metrics and win shares while also covering injury adjustments and sample size scaling.

🔹 1. Clutch Performance Metrics
Clutch stats measure how a player performs under pressure (e.g., final minutes of close games). These stats should be weighted separately from general performance to emphasize "game-winning ability."

🔍 Key Clutch Stats to Use
Clutch Time Net Rating – The player’s net rating only in the last 5 minutes when the game is within 5 points.
Clutch Points per Game – Points scored per game in clutch moments.
Clutch Effective Field Goal % (eFG%) – Measures shooting efficiency in pressure moments.
Win Probability Added (WPA) – How much a player’s actions increase their team’s win probability in clutch situations.
Clutch Usage Rate – Measures how involved a player is in clutch situations.
✅ How We Use Clutch Stats:

Weight separately in the score to reward high-impact, clutch players.
Apply the Games Played Factor (GPF) to avoid small sample size outliers (e.g., a player who hit one game-winner but rarely plays).
Consider a sliding scale where Clutch Metrics get more weight for star players.
Clutch Score Formula Example
\text{Clutch Score} = (0.4 \times \text{Clutch Net Rating}) + (0.3 \times \text{Clutch PPG}) + (0.2 \times \text{Clutch eFG%}) + (0.1 \times \text{WPA})
🔹 2. Win Shares (WS)
Win Shares is an advanced metric that estimates how much a player contributes to team wins.

🔍 Key Win Share Stats
Offensive Win Shares (OWS) – Contribution to wins from offensive play.
Defensive Win Shares (DWS) – Contribution to wins from defensive play.
Total Win Shares (WS) = OWS + DWS – Overall contribution to team success.
Win Shares per 48 Minutes (WS/48) – Win impact per 48 minutes played (useful for fair comparisons between high-minute and low-minute players).
✅ How We Use Win Shares:

Win Shares per 48 (WS/48) is the best for ranking impact (since raw WS can be skewed by minutes played).
Apply a small weight to DWS separately to ensure defensive anchors aren’t underrated.
Combine WS with Clutch Score for an overall “Winning Impact” metric.
Win Share Formula Example

(

)
Win Share Score=(0.6×WS/48)+(0.2×OWS)+(0.2×DWS)
🔹 3. Handling Small Sample Sizes (GPF)
Players with very few games played should not be overranked just because of small-sample outliers. We introduced a Games Played Factor (GPF) to adjust scores.

𝛼
=
0.75
α=0.75 (Moderate scaling, prevents extreme small-sample outliers).
This applies to: Net Rating, Plus-Minus, PIE, Usage, Clutch Metrics, Win Shares.
🔹 4. Injury Adjustments (Short-Term vs. Long-Term)
Some players miss a few games (short-term injury) while others are out for the season—we needed a way to adjust for this properly.

🛠 Injury Adjustment Strategy
Type of Injury	Adjustment
Short-Term (Expected to Return)	Use Hybrid Availability (blends total season GP and last 10 games)
Long-Term (Out for Season)	Remove from ranking OR scale their score to 10-20% of full score
Frequent Injuries (In & Out of Lineup)	Apply an exponential decay penalty based on games missed
Formula for Injury-Adjusted Availability

🔹 5. Scaling Minutes Consistency
We considered whether raw minutes, season-long minutes, or recent minutes should be used.

Final Choice: Hybrid Minutes Consistency

Hybrid Minutes Consistency=0.6×Season Avg Minutes+0.4×(1− 
Avg Minutes Last 10
Std Dev of Minutes Last 10
​
 )
✅ This rewards players who get consistent playing time without over-penalizing those with minor fluctuations.

📊 Final Ranking Formula
We integrate all the key factors into a single score:

Final Score
=
(
0.5

Win Share Score
)
+
(
0.3

Clutch Score
)
+
(
0.2

Hybrid Availability
)
Final Score=(0.5×Win Share Score)+(0.3×Clutch Score)+(0.2×Hybrid Availability)
Win Share Score (50%) – Measures full-season impact.
Clutch Score (30%) – Measures game-winning ability.
Hybrid Availability (20%) – Ensures injuries & consistency are considered.
🚀 Next Steps
Run the adjusted ranking formula with Clutch Score + Win Shares properly weighted.
Ensure availability scaling isn’t overly punishing injury-prone players.
Fine-tune small-sample players (like Plowden) to prevent misranking.
