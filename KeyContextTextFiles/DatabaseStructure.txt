Database Structure Changes:

Primary Key Constraints:

all_teams_misc_stats: Primary key on TEAM_ID
all_players_misc_stats: Primary key on PLAYER_ID
2024-25_historic_game_data: Composite primary key on (TEAM_ID, GAME_DATE)
all_player_game_stats: Composite primary key on (PLAYER_ID, GAME_DATE)
all_players_advanced_stats: Primary key on PLAYER_ID
all_players_estimated_stats: Primary key on PLAYER_ID


Foreign Key Constraints:

all_players_misc_stats → all_teams_misc_stats via TEAM_ID (RESTRICT)
all_player_game_stats → all_players_misc_stats via PLAYER_ID (CASCADE)
all_player_game_stats → all_teams_misc_stats via TEAM_ID (RESTRICT)
2024-25_historic_game_data → all_teams_misc_stats via TEAM_ID (RESTRICT)
all_players_advanced_stats → all_teams_misc_stats via TEAM_ID (RESTRICT)
all_players_estimated_stats → all_teams_misc_stats via TEAM_ID (RESTRICT)


Indexes Added:

idx_players_team_id on all_players_misc_stats(TEAM_ID)
idx_player_games_team_date on all_player_game_stats(TEAM_ID, GAME_DATE)
idx_historic_games_team on 2024-25_historic_game_data(TEAM_ID)
idx_advanced_player_team_id on all_players_advanced_stats(TEAM_ID)
idx_estimated_player_team_id on all_players_estimated_stats(TEAM_ID)


Column Modifications:

Added TEAM_ID INTEGER to all_player_game_stats
Renamed Player_ID to PLAYER_ID in all_player_game_stats



Update Script Changes:

Team Stats Updates:

Changed from DELETE + INSERT to UPSERT pattern
Uses temporary tables for staging data
Maintains referential integrity with foreign keys


Player Stats Updates:

Implemented UPSERT pattern for misc, advanced, and estimated stats
Maintains foreign key relationships
Preserves historical data integrity


Game Data Updates:

Daily team game data uses date-scoped deletions
Player game stats uses player-and-date-scoped deletions
Both maintain referential integrity while allowing updates



Key Implementation Notes:

Time-series data (games) uses date-scoped updates
Reference data (teams, players) uses UPSERT pattern
All foreign keys use RESTRICT deletion policy except player game stats
Indexes support foreign key relationships and common queries
All tables maintain proper referential integrity

This structure ensures data consistency while allowing efficient updates and maintains relationships between all tables in the database.
