# GameFlowDataBrain - Agent Instructions

> Part of [[BRAIN-INDEX]]

## What Is This Brain?

GameFlowData is a sports analytics and machine learning platform that predicts player prop bet outcomes using XGBoost quantile regression, Gaussian copula Monte Carlo simulation, and Black-Litterman market blending. The NBA pipeline is live and profitable. MLB and NCAAB pipelines are under development. This brain organizes the entire project — models, pipeline, product, infrastructure, business, and operations — so any AI agent can contribute effectively.

## Owner
- **Role**: Founder & Solo Developer
- **Context**: ~2-3 months into building. NBA system is production-ready and running daily on Railway with automated scraping, inference, paper trading, and Discord alerts. Dashboard is live on Vercel. Currently expanding to MLB (batter pipeline in progress) and planning Stripe monetization.
- **Goals**: Ship MLB models, monetize via Stripe subscriptions, grow user base, maintain NBA model profitability

## Brain Structure
- [[Models]] - NBA/MLB/NCAAB model development, calibration, backtesting, feature engineering
- [[Pipeline]] - Scrapers, linkers, processing, orchestration, scheduling
- [[Product]] - Dashboard features, UX decisions, frontend architecture
- [[Infrastructure]] - Railway, Vercel, Supabase, Discord, monitoring
- [[Business]] - Monetization, Stripe, pricing, growth strategy
- [[Operations]] - Daily runbooks, invariants, incident response, maintenance
- [[Decisions]] - Key technical and business decisions with rationale
- [[Assets]] - Images, videos, PDFs, mockups, screenshots
- [[Handoffs]] - Session continuity notes
- [[Templates]] - Reusable note structures

## Conventions
- Use [[wikilinks]] for all cross-references between notes, but ONLY link to files that exist. Never create wikilinks to files that haven't been created yet.
- Keep files concise and actionable
- Tag files with relevant hashtags for discoverability
- Check [[Assets]] for related images, videos, PDFs when working on any task
- Update Handoffs/ at the end of every work session
- Reference the [[Execution-Plan]] as the source of truth for build order

## Critical Invariants
These rules must NEVER be violated:
1. **NEVER deploy global conformal recalibration offsets** — 4x confirmed to hurt ROI
2. **NEVER put advanced stats scraping on Railway** — stats.nba.com blocks datacenter IPs
3. **Railway daily_stats_job uses CDN only** — `--cdn-only` flag, no stats.nba.com calls
4. **NEVER run non-concurrent CREATE INDEX on `raw_player_props_combined`** (67M+ rows)
5. **Empirical CDF for probabilities** — always `(samples > line).mean()`, never Gaussian CDF
6. **Python backend uses `postgres` role** (bypasses RLS). Dashboard uses `authenticated` role.
7. **Model's Q10 "miscalibration" IS the edge** — correcting it removes profitability

## Assets
The [[Assets]] folder contains images, videos, PDFs, and other media. When working on any task, check Assets/ for related materials. You can analyze images, read PDFs, and process any file dropped there.

## Agent Personas
Available specialized agents in .claude/agents/:
- [[builder]] - Implements features, ships code, makes technical decisions
- [[strategist]] - Product thinking, monetization, growth, go-to-market
- [[analyst]] - Model performance, calibration, backtesting, data analysis
- [[ops]] - Infrastructure, monitoring, pipeline health, incident response
